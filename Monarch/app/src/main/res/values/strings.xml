        Every Monarch has a journey and Methodist University is committed to delivering on the promise we make to each student to be successful in pursuing excellence in the classroom, on campus, and in the community. These experiences will enable students to be successful in graduate school or workplaces, and will ultimately result in lives of meaning and purpose.\n\n"

       —Dr. Ben Hancock, Jr., President\n\n"

      The Methodist University journey is about embracing experiences outside of the classroom, fulfilling the university’s mission to engage, enrich, and empower its students and community. The four components of the MU journey are Leadership Development, Community Engagement, Global Education, and Undergraduate Research and Creativity. These pathways are designed to prepare students for productive careers and successful lives. By exploring the pathways developed at MU, students gain the knowledge and skills to achieve positive change in society. They improve their local community in ways that extend beyond basic volunteerism and they grow in confidence, maturity, and self-awareness. They benefit from relationships with MU professors, who work as their mentors for both research and for life decisions. They study in a variety of countries across the globe, improve their communication skills, and network through impressive internships.\n\n"

        Methodist University is a place like no other. With over 2,400 students from 42 states and 55 countries, we develop global perspectives. We are engaged through campus activities, service projects, and athletics; enriched through the 80 majors and concentrations that span our rigorous curriculum; and empowered every step of the way for a future of excellence.\n\n"
